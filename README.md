# AlgoCratic Futures™ - CTS 285 Course Materials
## Teaching Software Development Through Corporate Dystopia

> *"The Algorithm provides structure. Structure provides learning."*

---

## What Is This?

This repository contains the complete course materials for **CTS 285: Systems Development Project**, an immersive educational experience that teaches software development through satirical corporate dystopia.

Students progress through color-coded "clearance levels" (INFRARED → RED → ORANGE → YELLOW → GREEN) while learning:
- Python programming and web development
- Git/GitHub collaboration workflows
- AI-assisted development practices
- Agile/Scrum methodology
- Professional resilience and problem-solving

**The Secret**: Students laugh at "The Algorithm's demands" while building genuine technical skills. The satire creates psychological safety for experimentation. They leave with real competencies and memorable experiences.

## The Clearance System

Students progress through color-coded levels:

| Clearance | Weeks | Focus | Key Skills |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| **INFRARED** | 1-2 | Basics | Python fundamentals, environment setup |
| **RED** | 3-5 | Collaboration | Git/GitHub, code review, debugging |
| **ORANGE** | 6-10 | Web & AI | Flask, AI-assisted development, sprints |
| **YELLOW** | 11-14 | Production | Optimization, deployment, integration |
| **GREEN** | 15-16 | Leadership | Documentation, mentoring, portfolio |

## The Dual Voice System

**Corporate Voice** (In-Character):
> "The Algorithm has identified optimization opportunities in citizen productivity metrics. You will implement the Voluntary Task Compliance Protocol™ (compliance is mandatory)."

**Out-of-Character Voice** (Technical):
> By completing this assignment, you will practice state management in web applications and implement user authentication basics. Time estimate: 8-10 hours.

**Underground Voice** (Troubleshooting):
> ```
> === BEGIN TRANSMISSION ===
> The Algorithm's session management has a weakness.
> Check flask.session - it's your friend.
> Stay coded. Stay hidden.
> === END TRANSMISSION ===
> ```

## Pedagogical Philosophy

### Core Principles

**95% Competence + 5% Satire = Memorable Learning**

1. **Competence First**: Every satirical element serves genuine skill development
2. **Psychological Safety**: Satire creates distance that allows experimentation
3. **Growth Over Perfection**: Reward iteration and improvement
4. **Professional Preparation**: Students leave ready for actual workplaces
5. **Joy in Learning**: If it's not fun to create, it won't be fun to complete

### Why Dystopia Works

The corporate dystopia narrative:
- **Reduces anxiety**: Exaggerated absurdity makes real challenges feel manageable
- **Builds resilience**: Prepares students for actual workplace dysfunction
- **Aids memory**: Emotional engagement creates lasting learning
- **Enables critique**: Students examine tech culture critically
- **Creates community**: Shared experience bonds cohorts

When graduates encounter their first impossible deadline, they think: "This isn't as bad as AlgoCratic Futures" and approach it with confidence.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this really 95% real education?**  
A: Yes. Students build actual applications, learn industry-standard tools, and develop professional portfolios. The satire is the wrapper, not the content.

**Q: Do students find the dystopia off-putting?**  
A: No - it's exaggerated enough to be clearly satirical. Students laugh while learning. The narrative reduces anxiety rather than creating it.

**Q: Can this work without the satire?**  
A: Yes, but it's less memorable and engaging. The narrative creates emotional investment in the material.

**Q: How much does this cost to run?**  
A: $0 with GitHub Education benefits. All tools are free for students.

**Q: What if students don't "get" the satire?**  
A: Technical content stands alone. Narrative is enhancement, not requirement for understanding.

## Acknowledgments

This course framework draws inspiration from:
- **Paranoia RPG** (clearance level system)
- **Portal/Aperture Science** (benevolent dystopia)
- **The Office** (bureaucratic absurdity)
- **1984** (surveillance culture critique)
- **Actual software development** (it's already absurd enough)

Built with insights from:
- Years of teaching experience
- Student resistance pattern research (FOBSS)
- Modern pedagogical best practices
- Industry collaboration feedback
- Trial and error (mostly error, which is fine)
